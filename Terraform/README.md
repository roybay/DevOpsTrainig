## Terraform Comments 

### Useful comments  
1.	Create .terraform folder and downloads necesery plugins to communicate to cloud provider(s)

		terraform init
1.	It check terraforms code and make sure that there is no issue. It usually works fine

		terraform plan

1.	It applies the change to the infrastructure 

		terraform apply

1.	It destroy all infrastructure in all platforms

		terraform destroy

1.	It check terraforms code and make sure that there is no issue. Donâ€™t need terraform plan

		terraform validate

1.	It fix the formatting issues. It usually works fine

		terraform fmt

1.	Without actually executing against the platform. it has sub commands

11.	list
11.	mv
11.	pull
11.	push
11.	rm
11.	show

		terraform state show <resource_name>
		Ex: terraform state show google_compute_network.our_development_network

1.	Create the diagram for all infrasturcture

11.	There is a dependency: GraphViz or dot
	
		terraform graph | dot -Tsvg > graph.svg
	 

### Good to know comments

1.	terraform workspace offers many workspaces. new	creates a new workspace 

		terraform workspace new <name>

1.	list 	List Workspaces

		terraform workspace list 

1.	select 	Select a workspace

		terraform workspace select <name>

1.	delete 	Delete a workspace

		terraform workspace delete <name>

1.	show 	Show the name of the current workspace

		terraform workspace show
 
1.	Return output variables assigned value

		terraform output

1.	imports the existing configuration from cloud provider into state file 

		terraform import

1.	force to unlock but it is kind off dengerus because it may create an conflict on the state

		terraform force-unlock

1.	if there is any changes on the cloud configuration 

		terraform refresh

1.	allow as to select any resource and then terraform apply it create that resource again. 

		terraform taint <resource name>
